0,As always, marriage tends to constrict oneself over time. My Poochie needs a dangerous upgrade to... rectify this situation. 
1,I can always trust you to terrify.
2,What an exceptional display of mediocrity.
3,I’d watch your back in the future.
4,My daughter is cute, but she could always be cuter!
5,This upgrade is like mewsic to my ears! Kyaaaa~!
6,Well, at least she’ll always have her purrrsonality.
7,What a CATastrophy!
8,I want to take my familiar on a rockin’ roadtrip to Creepytown.
9,You’re nailing it like a demon!
10,Yeah, it was...good!
11,This is Capital T Terrible.
12,Ah, hello, young Zeusly. You’ve come just in time. Today is your first day as head of the necrofixer shop.
13,The untimely death of a beloved pet always fills the owner with great remorse.
14,Luckily, that’s what we necrofixers are here to monetize… I mean, help with.
15,But the owners don’t just want their animal revived- they want them enhanced!  
16,Each customer will have a specific look in mind. Click on the familiar’s body parts to change them. 
28,You’re a total amateur who failed out of the academy, so don’t expect to control your magic and choose what appears. 
29,Clients are impatient. Keep an eye on the clock in the upper right hand corner!
30,Lastly, this business lives and dies by customer reviews.
31,Make folks happy, you’ll get five stars. Disappoint them, you’ll get low ratings and risk being run out of business.
32,Oh, and here comes your first customer…*poof*
17,I’ve run out of patience for your platitudes.
18,UnFURtunately, you’re all out of time!
19,Holy Moly! Time passed like a demon. Better luck next time...
20,You have managed to evade the authorities and bring your amalgamations glory for years to come. You will soon become mayor of your village and the most famous necrofixer in the world.
21,You might've scarred some people for life, but hey, they knew what they signed up for.                         ...right?
22,Your store is being investigated for crimes against all living creatures. You have been run out of town by an angry mob.
23,This is Bomb.Com Bangin’!
24,Holy Moly! Maybe next time, my man!
25,I wouldn’t even put this on the grill.
26,This wait time was NOT funkalicious
27,Hey! Girl Fieri here. My familiar is one stop away from funky fresh - my brother said you could help return her to full form?
